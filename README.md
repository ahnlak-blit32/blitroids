# Blitroids

![Build](https://github.com/ahnlak-blit32/blitroids/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

**Blitroids** is an Asteroids-inspired arcade game developed for the 32Blit
console, although thanks to the excellent 32Blit pipeline it will also be available
for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Web!

The aim is simple enough; survive and destroy all the asteroids (and other things!)
that would like to see you atomised and scattered through space in tiny pieces.


This game is distributed under the MIT License, in the hope that the source may
prove educational to anyone else interested in developing for the 32Blit. Please
only take the good stuff, and do not acquire any of my bad habits :-)

Share and Enjoy!
